# Introduction
A modern architectures executes instruction via a processor, which is composed by one or more execution units(core), which fetch the data from the primary memory, decodes it and executes it to run a thread.

The instruction were once executed in order, but nowadays the instruction are fetched in order, executed out of order using multiple execution units and reservation station, which are buffers, and reordered by a reorder buffer to get the correct result of the computation.

The computer architectures have reached the point where physical constrains hinders the improvement of performance by making the hardware faster, so we had to resort to run multiple instruction by parallelizing the execution of instruction, with method such as pipelining and dynamic scheduling.
## Different kinds of microarchitecture
There are actually different types of architectures, which uses different ways to store the an operand:

- stack-based architecture: the results of computation are stored on a stack(a LIFO data structure)
- accumulator-based architecture: the result is stored in a operand, which is implicitly an accumulator
- register-memory-based architecture: the instruction of this architecture uses only an implicit operand
- load-store-based architecture: this architecture uses two implicit operation, and can only manage registers operations

Another way to discern architectures is the number of memory operands used per ALU istructions.
# Instruction set Architecture
An **instruction set architecture** is the set of instruction which is the portion of the computer visible to the programmer or compiler.

Modern ISAs uses general-purpose registers to perform operations for two main reasons:
- registers are faster than memory
- registers are easier for a compiler to use

## Memory Addressing
An architecture *must* define how memory addresses are interpreted and how they are specified.
### Little Endian vs Big endian
There are two different convention for ordering the bytes within a larger object:
- Big Endian: the least-significant bit first

- Little Endian: the more significant bit first

> When operating within one computer, the byte order is often unnoticeable
### Memory alignment
We can store in memory large objects, an the access to those must be aligned: an access of $s$ bytes at a byte address $A$ is aligned if $A\mod s =0$.

> Misalignment causes hardware complications, because the memory is typically aligned on a multiple of a word or double-word boundary.

### Addressing Modes
An architecture must specify how the address of an object is specified.

Addressing modes specify constants and registers in addition to locations in memory. When a memory location is used, the actual
memory address specified by the addressing mode is called the effective address.

Addressing modes have the ability to significantly reduce instruction counts; they also add to the complexity of building a computer and may increase the average clock cycles per instruction (CPI) of computers that implement those modes. Thus, the usage of various addressing modes is quite important in helping the architect choose what to include.

By carefully choosing the addressing modes, one can
obtain some important consequences:
- Reducing the number of instructions
- Increasing the CPU architecture complexity
- Increasing the average Cycles Per Instruction (CPI)
### Operations in the Instruction Set
Most ISAs can be categorized by the type of computation that they can carry out.

> One rule of thumb across all architectures is that the most widely executed instructions are the simple operations of an instruction set. This is because not all the instructions are executed at the same frequency.
### Types and sizes of Operands
%% maybe add later, they werent part of the lecture%%
### Control flow instructions
We can distinguish four different types of control flow change:
- Conditional branches
- Jumps
- Procedure calls
- Procedure returns

Conditional branches are by far the most frequently
executed control flow instructions, and they cause hazard on the flow of the program, which must be handled.
