### MIPS64
MIPS architecture (or Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages) is a family of RISC processors, which have been very successful for embedded applications

> The first processor in the family was introduced in 1985, and several versions have been introduced since then.

This processor has a simple load-store instruction set and is designed for pipeline efficiency, introducing fixed instruction length, which is ideal for low power applications.
#### Data types
MIPS supports most of the common data types:
- Byte (8 bits)
-  Half Words (16 bits)
- Words (32 bits)
- Double Words (64 bits)
- 32-bit single precision floating-point
- 64-bit double precision floating-point.
#### Addressing Modes
For memory addressing, it uses a 16 bits Immediate Field format.

> `DADDUI R1, R2, #32` is R1 <- R2 + 32
> `DADDUI R1, R0, #32` is R1 <- 32

It also support displacement mode.

> `LD R1, 30(R2)` is R1 <- MEM[R2 + 30]
#### Instruction Formats
All instruction have a fixed length, encoded in 32 bits.
There are 3 formats of these instruction.
- immediate
- register
- jump
##### Immediate format
An instruction in immediate mode is composed of:
- an opcode of 6 bits
- the source register of 6 bits
- the destination register of 5 bits
- the immediate operand, composed of 16 bits. It is a signed number

###### Jump format

#### Instruction Set 
In the MIPS architecture, the instructions are sorted in groups:
- Load and store
- ALU operations
- Branches and Jumps
- Floating Point
- Miscellaneous

Each one of those is a 32 bit instruction.
##### Load and Stores
MIPS processors implements a load/store architecture. As such, to access the memory dedicated instruction must be used

Instruction|When used|Example|Meaning
--|--|--|--
LD|Load Double Word|`LD R1, 28(R8)`|R1 <- MEM(R8 + 28)
LB|Load Byte|`LB R1, 28(R8)`|
LBU|Load Byte Unsigned|`LBU R1, 28(R8)`|
L.S|Load FP single|`L.S F4, 46(R5)`|
L.D|Load FP Double|`L.D F4, 46(R5)`|
SD|Store Double|`SD R1, 28(R8)`|MEM[R8 + 28] <- R1
SW|Store Word|`SW R1, 28(R8)`|
SH|Store Half word|`SH R1, 28(R8)`|
SB|Store Byte|`SB R1, 28(R8)`|
S.S|Store FP Single|`F4, 28(R8)`
S.D|Store FP Double|`S.D F4, 28(R8)` |
##### ALU Operations
All operations are performed on operands held in processor registers.

There are four kinds of instruction that are allowed:
- Immediate and three-operand instructions
- Two operand instructions
- Shift Instructions
- Multiply and divide instruction

Furthermore, it allows all the four basic mathematical operation in 2's complement arithmetic.

Instruction|When used|Example|Meaning
--|--|--|--
DADDU|Double Add Unsigned|`DADDU R1,R2,R3 `|R1 <- R2 + R3
DADDUI|Double Add Unsigned Immediate|`DADDUI R1,R2,#74 `|R1 <- R2 + 74
LUI|Load Upper Immediate|`LUI R1,0x47`|
DSLL| Double Shift left logical|`DSLL R1,R2,#3`|R1 <- R2 <<3
SLT|Set Less than|`SLT R1,R2,R3 `|IF (R2 < R3) R1 <- 1 ;ELSE R1 <- 0|
J| Unconditional Jump |`J name` |PC <- name
JAL |Jump and Link| `JAL name` |R31 <- PC+4; PC <- name
JALR| Jump and Link Register| JALR R4 | R31 <- PC+4; PC <- R4
JR| Jump Register|`JR R3`| PC <- R3
BEQZ| Branch Equal Zero| `BEQZ R4,name`| IF (R4 = 0) then PC <- name
BNE| Branch Not Equal|`BNE R3,R4,name` |IF (R3 != R4) then PC <- name
MOVZ |Conditional Move if Zero|`MOVZ R1,R2,R3` |IF (R3 = 0) then R1 <- R2
NOP| No Operation|`NOP` |It means SLL R0, R0, 0
##### Floating Point
The floating point unit(FPU) instruction includes almost the same instructions types:
- Data Transfer Instructions
- Arithmetic Instructions
- Conditional Branch Instructions
- Miscellaneous Instructions
#### Assembler Programs
An assembler program for MIPS64 architecture is divided in two sections:
- the **data section**, which includes the variables and constants
- the **code section**, which contains the program instructions, the routines and the subroutines

The data section can be described by the following picture.

The code section can be described by the following picture.

##### Assembler directives
Name| Meaning
--|--
.data | start of data segment
.text | start of code segment
.code | start of code segment (same as .text)
.org ``<n>``| start address
.space ``<n>`` | leave n empty bytes
.asciiz `<s>` | enters zero terminated ascii string
.ascii `<s>` | enter ascii string
.align `<n>` | align to n-byte boundary â€¦
.word `<n1>,<n2>`.. | enter word(s) of data (64-bits)
.byte `<n1>,<n2>`.. | enter bytes
.word32 `<n1>,<n2>`.. | enter 32 bit number(s)
.word16 `<n1>,<n2>`.. | enter 16 bit number(s)
.double `<n1>,<n2>`.. | enter floating-point number(s)

where `<n>` denotes a number like 24, `<s>` denotes a string like "fred", and `<n1>,<n2>`.. denotes numbers separated by commas.

###### A simple example
```assembly
; Write a program that add two numbers
.data
  Val_a:  .word 10
  Val_b:  .word 20
  Val_c:  .word 0
.text ; Can use both .code or .text
  Main: 
    ld R1, Val_a(R0) ; Load value of Val_A into R1
    ld R2, Val_b(R0) ; Load value of Val_B into R2
    dadd R3, R1, R2  ; Add R1 and R2 and store the result in R3
    sd R3, Val_c(R0) ; Store the value of R3 in Val_C
    halt             ; Stop the program

```
