### MIPS64
MIPS architecture (or Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages) is a family of RISC processors, which have been very successful for embedded applications

#### Data types
- Byte (8 bits)
-  Half Words (16 bits)
- Words (32 bits)
- Double Words (64 bits)
- 32-bit single precision floating-point
- 64-bit double precision floating-point.

#### Addressing Modes

#### Instruction Formats
All intruction have a fixed length, encoded in 32 bits.
there are 3 formats of these instruction.
##### Immediate format
An istruction in immediate mode is ocmpose of:
- an opcode of 6 bits
- the source register of 6 bits
- the destination register of 5 bits
- the immediate operand, composed of 16 bits. It is a signed number

###### Register mode

###### Jump format

#### Instruction Set 
In the MIPS architecture, the instructions are sorted in groups:
- Load and store
- ALU operations
- Branches and Jumps
- Floating Point
- Miscellaneous

Each one of this is a 32 bit instruction.
##### Program memory organization
All assembler programs are organized in a predefined way:
- first there is a data nation, which stores the variables and the constants
![[Pasted image 20231016134103.png|550]]
- after that there's the code section, where the program, routine and subroutine code is stored

###### A simple example
```assembly
; Write a program that add two numbers
.data
  Val_a:  .word 10
  Val_b:  .word 20
  Val_c:  .word 0
.text ; Can use both .code or .text
  Main: 
    ld R1, Val_a(R0) ; Load value of Val_A into R1
    ld R2, Val_b(R0) ; Load value of Val_B into R2
    dadd R3, R1, R2  ; Add R1 and R2 and store the result in R3
    sd R3, Val_c(R0) ; Store the value of R3 in Val_C
    halt             ; Stop the program

```
