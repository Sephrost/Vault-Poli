## Cryptography
A cryptosystem is a system that allows a plaintext message(known as $P$) is encrypted with a key $K$ to create an encrypted message $C$, know as cyphertext.

if the keys:
- are kept secret
- are managed only by trusted systems
- are of adequate length
then it has no importance that the encryption and decryption
algorithms are kept secret, on the contrary it is better to make the algorithms public so that they can be widely analysed and their possible weaknesses identified.

### DES
DES is a symmetric block cipher that uses a 64 bit key(56 are the actually used one + 8 parity bits). 

It is designed to be efficient n hardware because it required:
- XOR
- Shift
- permutation
operations.
#### Triple DES
Because of its vulnerability to brute-force attack, DES, a better approach is to use more keys, and encrypt more times.

Triple DES can either use:
- two keys $C = E(K_2, E(K_1, P))$
- three keys $C = E(K_3,E(K_2, E(K_1, P)))$

These cipher are not really useful because of an attack called **meet-in-the-middle**, which exploits a simple observation: the result of the first encryption is the result of the second decryption:
if we have 
$$C = E(K_2, E(K_1, P))$$
then
$$X = E(K_1, P) = D(K_2, C)$$

Given a known pair, $(P, C)$, the attack proceeds as follows. First, encrypt $P$ for all $256$ possible values of $K_1$. Store these results in a table and then sort the table by the values of $X$. Next, decrypt $C$ using all $256$ possible values of $K_2$. As each decryption is produced, check the result against the table for a match. If a match occurs, then test the two resulting keys against a new known plaintext–ciphertext pair. If the two keys produce the correct ciphertext, accept them as the correct keys.


For any given plaintext $P$, there are $264$ possible ciphertext values that could be produced by double DES. Double DES uses, in effect, a $112$-bit key, so that there are $2^{112}$ possible keys. Therefore, for a given plaintext $P$, the maximum number of different $112$-bit keys that could produce a given ciphertext $C$ is $2^{112}/264$ = $248$.
### Mode of applications
A block cipher takes a **fixed-length block** of text of length $b$ bits and a key as input and produces a b-bit block of ciphertext. 

If the amount of **plaintext** to be encrypted is **greater than that**, then the block cipher can still be used by breaking the plaintext up into $b$-bit blocks. When multiple blocks of plaintext are encrypted using the same key, a number of security issues arise. To apply a block cipher in a variety of applications, **five modes of operation** have been defined by NIST.
#### ECB - Electronic Code Book
> Is the simplest mode, which should not be used and is explained only for historical reasons.

For a message longer than b bits, the procedure is simply to break the message into b-bit blocks, padding the last block if necessary.

> The ECB mode should be used only to secure messages shorter than a single block of underlying cipher

So if the same $b$-bit block of plaintext appears more than once in the message, it always produces the same ciphertext, and is possible to create a table of possible outputs and run a lookup when necessary.

#### CBC - Cipher Block Chaining
In this scheme, the input to the encryption algorithm is the XOR of the current plaintext block and the preceding ciphertext block; the same key is used for each
block.

Because we don't have an output to XOR to the first block, we use an initialization vector $IV$, which is used to avoid pre-computation.

>So long as it is unpredictable, the specific choice of IV is unimportant.

> We also note than an error on computation propagates to the following blocks to be encrypted.

#### CTR - Counter mode
A counter equal to the plaintext block size is used, which must be different from any plaintext block that is encrypted.

>Typically, the counter is initialized to some value and then incremented by 1 for each subsequent block(modulo $2^b$, where $b$ is the block size).

For encryption, the counter is encrypted and then XORed with the plaintext block to produce the ciphertext block

> So no padding needed and random direct access to ciphertext.

### Padding
If the length of the message is not an exact multiple of the size of a block,**padding** must be added to make encryption with block ciphers possible. There are many ways to specify the padding bits(all null byes, length-1,$\dots$).

Even if padding is not required it must be added to avoid any error in the interpretation of the last block.
### Ciphertext stealing(CTS)
An alternative to padding is using **Ciphertext stealing**, which involves some modification to the last two blocks.
