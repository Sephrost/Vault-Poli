### Elliptic curve cryptography
Rather than using normal modular memory, we consider on a 2D surface, where each data is defined by two coordinated (x and y).

Operations made in this way are much more complex than problems in arithmetic, but it allows to use shorter keys(about 1/10 of the normal length).

> Algorithms that starts with **EC** use elliptic curve.
### Integrity of a message
A communication can be encrypted, granting thus confidentiality, but an attacker can modify it in an unpredictable way, simply by changing some bits! 
#### Digest
A digest is a summary used to verify if a message has been modified or not.

The message digest is a fixed-length *summary* of the message to be protected. I has fixed length.

It also must be:
- fast to compute
- impossible or very difficult to invert
- difficult to create **collisions**

Digest are often used to avoid performing operation of the whole message.
#### Hash functions
An hash function splits the message $M$ in $n$ blocks $M_1,M_2,\dots M_n$.

> It does not use a keys, so the resistance is given by the length of the digest.
###### Digest length
so the resistance of this approach is given by the length of the digest. So it is important to avoid aliasing, of *collisions*.

So given some values $m_1$ and $m_2$, $H(m_1)$ must be different from $H(m_2)$.

If an algorithm is well designed and generates a digest of $N$ bits, then the probability of aliasing is $P_A \propto\frac{1}{2^N}$. (inversely proportional)

Thus, digest with many bits are required.

##### KDF - Key Derivation function
A cryptographic key must be random (each bit has 50% probability to be 0 or 1), but users typically insert passwords (or better passphrases) guessable and not random.

So to generate a random password, we can use **Key Derivation function** to generate a key by using a passphrase and a salt, which is a random number to make an unpredictable variation.

$$K=KDF(P,S,I)$$
where:
- P is a password or passphrase
- S is the salt (to make K difficult to guess given P)
- I is number of iterations of the base function (to slow down the computation and make life complex for attackers)
###### PBKDF2
RFC-8018, replaces PBKDF1 (limited to keys <= 160 bit)

The key is generated in the following way
$$DK = PBKDF2( PRF, PWD, Salt, C, dkLen )$$
where:
- PRF = pseudorandom function of two parameters with output length hLen (e.g. a keyed HMAC)
- PWD = password from which a derived key is generated
- Salt = cryptographic salt
- C = number of iterations desired
- dkLen = desired length of the derived key
- DK = generated derived key = $T_1 || T_2 || \dots || T_{dkLen/hLen}$ (where each $| T_i | = hLen$)

PBKDF2 can be attacked because C may be large but this requires only a lot of computation but not a lot of RAM, hence it can be attacked by ASIC or GPU.

#### Keyed-Digest
To guarantee authentication on the digest, the sender could also send the digest calculated not only on the data, but also on a shared secret, so that only who knows the key can compare the transmitted digest.

The steps are as follows:
- (sender) d = digest( K, M )
- (transmission) M || d
- (receiver) d' = digest( K, M )
- (verification) if ( d == d' ) then OK else ALARM!

It presents some advantages:
- it requires only one operation (digest)
- we transmit few additional data
- it guarantees authentication *and* integrity

> It is usually used in high speed networks.
##### HMAC
The HMAC can be expressed as
$$HMAC(K, M) = H[(K + ⊕ opad) || H[(K + ⊕ ipad) || M]]$$

We can describe the algorithm as follows:
1. Append zeros to the left end of K to create a b-bit string K + (e.g., if K is of
length 160 bits and b = 512, then K will be appended with 44 zeroes).
2. XOR (bitwise exclusive-OR) K + with ipad to produce the b-bit block Si.
3. Append M to Si.
4. Apply H to the stream generated in step 3.
5. XOR K + with opad to produce the b-bit block So.
6. Append the hash result from step 4 to So.
7. Apply H to the stream generated in step 6 and output the result.

where
- ipad = 00110110 (36 in hexadecimal) repeated b/8 times
- opad = 01011100 (5C in hexadecimal) repeated b/8 times
#### Integrity an secracy
We have various solutions to grant integrity and secrecy.
###### Option 1 - authenticate-and-encrypt
We first encrypt and then compute the digest (enc( K1 , p ) || mac( K2 , p ))

Must always decrypt before checking integrity (possible DoS attack)
It may leak info about the plaintext.
###### Option 2 – authenticate-then-encrypt
We first authenticate, computing the digest and then encrypt it(enc( K1 , p || mac( K 2 , p ) ))

With this approach, we must always decrypt before checking integrity.

The mac will thus not leak information.
###### Option 3 – encrypt-then-authenticate
We first encrypt and then concat that to the key(enc( K1 , p ) || mac( K2 , enc( K1 , p ) )))

With this solution we don't leak information.
#### Authenticated Encryption (AE)
a single operation for privacy and authentication/integrity:
- just one key and one algorithm
- better speed
- less error likelihood in combining the two functions
