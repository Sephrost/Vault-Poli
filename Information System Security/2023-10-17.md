### Stream Encryption algorithms
Stream encryption algorithms doesnt encrypt the message dividing it in blocks of the same size, but use them as a stream of bits(or bytes). It also uses a keys as long as the message.

The ideal algorithm of symmetric encryption is the **One-time pad**, which uses a key as long as the message, but have no real application.

So usually a seed is used to initialize a key generator, to generate a key as long as the message. This method is also vulnerable to MITM, in particular to the cancellation of one bit, which de-synchronize the sender and the receiver.
### Length of Secret keys
Which length of a key is considered secure? 

If the Kerchoff's condition are satisfied:
- the encryption algorithm was well designed
- the keys, Nbit in length, are kept secret
- the algorithm is executed by a trusted party (e.g. no malware)
the only possible attack is an exhaustive one, which requires an exponential computation time($2^n$)

## Asymmetric Encryption
Symmetric encryption is Â¨good" if two parties have to communicate, because we have only a key,but if we have a a lot of receivers $N\times(n-1)/2$ keys are necessary. For this we have two solutions:
- distribution out-of-bounds
- distribution by means of key exchange algorithms

For the key distribution problems, public key encryption, or asymmetric cryptography, have been created.
With this method the sender and the receiver have two pairs of keys: one used for encryption, the secret one, and one for decryption, the public one.Data encrypted with one key can be encrypted with the other one of the pair.

It also allow to have confidentiality without sharing secrets.
### Digital signature and key distribution
Digital signature uses a public key to allow anyone to verify that a message comes from a party, because only that one could have encrypted the message, granting authentication and integrity.
### Diffie-Hellman key exchange
Diffie-Hellman algorithm is used to agree on a shared value.
For this scheme, there are two publicly known numbers: a prime number $q$ and an integer $a$ that is a primitive root of $q$.

Suppose the users Alice and Bob wish to create a
shared key.
1. Alice selects a random integer $X_A < q$ and computes $Y_A = a^{X_A} \mod q$.
2. Bob independently selects a random integer $X_B < q$ and computes $Y_B = a^{X_B} \mod q$.
3. Each side keeps the $X$ value private and makes the $Y$ value available publicly to the other side
4. Alice computes the key as $K = (Y_B)^{X_A} \mod q$ and Bob computes the key as $K = (Y_A)^{X_B} \mod q$.
These two calculations produce identical results.
#### MITM on Diffie-Hellman
This method is resistant to sniffing attack, but not to MITM attacks.

Suppose Alice and Bob wish to exchange keys, and Darth is the adversary. The attack proceeds as follows:
1. Darth prepares for the attack by generating two random private keys $X_{D1}$ and $X_{D2}$ and then computing the corresponding public keys $Y_{D1}$ and $Y_{D2}$.
2. Alice transmits $Y_A$ to Bob.
3. Darth intercepts $Y_A$ and transmits $Y_{D1 to Bob. Darth also calculates K2 = (YA)XD2 mod q.
4. Bob receives YD1 and calculates K1 = (YD1)XB mod q.
5. Bob transmits YB to Alice.
6. Darth intercepts YB and transmits YD2 to Alice. Darth calculates
K1 = (YB)XD1 mod q.
7. Alice receives YD2 and calculates K2 = (YD2)XA mod q.
