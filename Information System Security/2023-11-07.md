## Authentication
**User authentication** is the process of **determining** whether some user or some application or process acting on behalf of a user is, in fact, who or what it declares itself to be.

> As a shorthand for authentication we use *authC*.
### Authentication Factor
What can we use to authenticate someone or something?

It's possible to use different factors:
- **knowledge**: something that only the user knows, such as a static password
- ownership: something that only the user possess, called an **authenticator**
- **inheritance**: something that the user is, such as bio metric characteristics

Each of those factors carries a risk: the authentication can be stolen or the bio metric characteristics can be counterfeited.

> Bio metrics should be used only for local authentication, as a mechanism to unlock a secret or a device, because they cant be replaced.
### Digital authentication model (NIST SP 800-63)
NIST SP 800-63 (Digital Identity Guidelines) defines a general model for user authentication that involves a number of entities and procedures.

The general structure can be summarized in the following picture:
![[Pasted image 20231107162438.png]]

Three concepts are important in understanding this model:
- **Digital identity**: The unique representation of a subject engaged in an online transaction, which consists of an attribute or set of attributes that uniquely describe a subject within a given context of a digital service, but does not necessarily uniquely identify the subject in all contexts.
- **Identity proofing**: Establishes that a subject is who they claim to be to a stated level of certitude. This process involves collecting, validating, and verifying information about a person.
- **Digital authentication**: The process of determining the validity of one or more authenticators used to claim a digital identity. Authentication establishes that a subject attempting to access a digital service is in control of the technologies used to authenticate. Successful authentication provides reasonable risk-based assurances that the subject accessing the service today is the same as the sub- ject that previously accessed the service.

#### Generic authentication protocol
To authenticate a claimant, the verifier sends an authentication request to this one, which, one provided, is not suffient for authentication. As such, he should provide a proof associated with his user identifier, transmitting it to the verifier.

##### (reusable) Password
A proof of authentication is the use of reusable password, which are stored directly by the verifier(which is bad), or a value depending from it(such as an hash value).

![[Pasted image 20231107163546.png]]

The verifier compares the provided value, of its hash, and if they are equal, the claimant can be authenticated.

This approach hash some issued:
- password can be guessed
- passwords can be enumerated, with a bruteforce approach(feasible if the length of the value is limited) if the protocol does not block repeated failures.
- passwords can be used for different services(and often are), so if a service is compromised, the others that share the same value are for the same user
- the cryptography algorithm hasn't aged well, and is now attackable
- passwords can be captured via sniffing and phishing
- passwords are vulnerable to password attacks

To make password **less dangerous** to use, some **best practices** can be implemented to reduce the associated risk:
- different kinds of characters should be used
	- alphabetic characters (uppercase + lowercase) + digits + special characters
- use at least 8 characters
	- this is the bare minimum!
- never use dictionary words
	- no "batman" innit
-  frequently changed (but not too frequently!)
	- change it before the attacker has the time to bruteforce it
- the best approach is not to use it
	- but usage of at least one password (or PIN, or access code) is unavoidable, unless we adopt biometric techniques

#### Password Storege
We discuss first the server-side storage and then the client side.

First of all: NEVER store them in clear text.
Encryption of a password is not feasible, because then the verified should know the cleartext.

#### Dictionary attack
For execution with success a disctionary attack, two requirements must be met:
- the hash algorithm should be known
- the hash value of the password must also be known

The attack is carried as described:
- a dictionary is pre-computated to generate a table that associates each word innit to the corresponding computated hash value
- we lookup if the hash value of the password is present in the table
- if the condition is met, the attack is successful
##### Rainbow table attack
The databases can be very big, requiring a lot of time to be computed, and also a lot of memory to be stored.

Rainbow tables are a space-time trade-off technique to store (and lookup) an exhaustive hash table (less space, more time), making the attack feasible for certain password sets.

An attacker can use a reduction function $r:h\to p$, that given an hash value generates a password(which is not $h^{-1}$). $r$ computes as followed:
```c
for (10^9 distinct P )
	for(p=P, n=0; n<1000; n++)
		k = h(p); p = r(k);
	store ( DB, P, p ) // chain head and tail
```

Having precomputed that

#### Salting the password
To make dictionary attack more difficult, a **salt value** can be used when a password is enrolled.

This is generated for each user, must be unpredictable and long, and should contain rarely used or control characters.

The salt is stored along the user identifier and the password's hash, making dictionary attacks nearly impossible, included those based on rainbow tables.
#### Challenge-response authentication(CRA)
Challenge-response is the authentication method where the claimant provides the response to an authentication request based on the value provided by the authenticator.
![[Pasted image 20231107175211.png]]

To avoid replay attacks, the challenge must be a random nonce, and the response function must be non-invertible, otherwise a listener can easly find the shared secret.


Challenge-response authentication can use a shared key between the verifier and the claimant. The he easiest implementation uses a hash function, which is faster than encryption(sha2/3 is recommended). The secret key is known in plaintext by the verifier, which make possible attack tho verifier's table, and that can be solved by using SCRAM(Slated CRA Mechanism).
###### Attack to CRA
The system can be attacked by performing two different challenge simultaneously on two different connections.
