###### Question 2
Assume Alice sends to Bob a Plain message m along with its digest md=h(m) over an insecure channel. 
Assume Eve is an active attacker controlling the channel between Alice and Bob (i.e. can read, delete, modify, inject data). Bob receives both the message and the digest. What would tell Bob that the message has been modified?
- [ ] the public key has been altered
- [ ] the message digest has been altered
- [ ] the message digest computed by Bob is different from the one sent by Alice
- [ ] the message extracted by Bob from the digest — i.e. $mBob=h-1(md)$ — is different from the message received m
- [x] none of the above

> E. none of the above, because Eve can change m to m' and replace h(m) with h(m')
###### Problem 1
Alice wants to protect for integrity one file $F$ on her disk (unprotected). 
She performs these steps:
1. she calculates a digest of the file, $D = h(F)$
2. she copies D on a secure storage (e.g. a USB pen)
where she also keeps other sensitive data (e.g. her RSA key-pair)
After one year, Alice wants to check if F has been illegally modified, so she takes the file F from disk and recalculates the digest on the file, $D' = h(F)$

What would indicate to Alice that F has been modified?
- [ ] the file F has a different creation time
- [ ] the private key has been altered
- [x] the message digest D stored in the secure storage is different from the message digest D' recalculated on F
- [ ] the message digest D stored in the secure storage is the same as the message digest D' recalculated on F
- [ ] none of the above
###### Question 3
If different messages generate the same hash value, how is
this called?
- [ ] secure hashing
- [x] collision
- [ ] MAC generation
- [ ] HMAC generation
###### Question 4
Given a message m1, after 100,000 random attempts Alice finds a message m2 that generates the same hash value when calculated with the algorithm H. 
Is H a secure hash algorithm?
- [ ] yes
- [x] no
- [ ] it depends on the length of the output generated by H
- [ ] it depends on the key used in the computation
###### Question 5
HMAC is an algorithm that allows:
- [x] to combine a message with a symmetric key to provide data authentication and integrity
- [ ] to combine a message with an asymmetric private key to provide data authentication and integrity
- [ ] to combine a message with an asymmetric public key to provide data authentication and integrity
- [ ] to combine a message with a symmetric key to provide data authentication, integrity, and non-repudiation
- [ ] to combine a message with an asymmetric private key to provide data authentication, integrity, and non-repudiation
###### Question 6
Which of the following best describes the difference between HMAC and CBC-MAC?
- [ ] HMAC creates a message digest and is used for integrity CBC-MAC is used to encrypt blocks of data for confidentiality
- [ ] HMAC uses a symmetric key and a hash algorithm; CBC-MAC uses the first encrypted block as a checksum
- [x] HMAC and CBC-MAC provide integrity and data authentication; HMAC uses a hash function, while CBC-MAC uses a block encryption algorithm
- [ ] HMAC encrypts a message with a symmetric key and then puts the results through a hash algorithm; CBC-MAC encrypts the whole message
###### Question 7
Alice wants to protect some messages $m_1, m_2, \dots, m_N$ for data authentication and integrity. She constructs for each message a MAC in the following manner:
for( i=1,i<=n; i++) mac($i$) = HMAC-SHA256( $i, m_i$)
She sends each message m and the corresponding $mac(i)$ to Bob over an unprotected channel.
Is data authentication and integrity achieved for all messages $m_i$? (justify your answer)
- [ ] yes
- [x] no
###### Question 8
Alice wants to send Bob a plaintext P protected for confidentiality, authentication, and integrity.
Alice and Bobs share two symmetric keys $K1$ and K2
Alice and Bob agreed on two algorithms, $A1$ (for MAC) and $A2$ (for symmetric encryption)

which operations should Alice perform on $P$ and what data should she transmit to Bob so that he can recover the plaintext and verify its integrity and authenticity?

###### Question 10
Authenticated Encryption provides:
- [ ] confidentiality and authentication/integrity in one step with two different keys
- [x] confidentiality and authentication/integrity in one step with one key
- [ ] confidentiality and authentication/integrity in two steps with one key
###### question
Which of the following best describes a Certification Authority?
- [ ] an organization that issues private keys and the corresponding algorithms
- [ ] an organization that certifies encryption algorithms
- [ ] an organization that certifies encryption keys
- [x] an organization that issues public-key certificates to entities
###### Question
Assume a CA issues an X.509v3 certificate to Alice. Which of the following values are included in the certificate issued to Alice? Select all that apply.
- [x] Alice's public key
- [ ] Alice's private key
- [x] A signature on Alice's X.509v3 certificate, calculated with the CA s private key
- [ ] A signature of the Alice's X.509v3 certificate, calculated with the CA's public key
- [x] An indication of the owner of the certificate, such as the Alice's name or e-mail address
- [x] A time period, indicating the lifetime of the certificate
- [x] An indication of the issuer of the certificate, such as the CA's name
###### Question
Why would a Certification Authority revoke a certificate?
- [ ] if the subject's public key has been compromised
- [x] if the subject's private key has been compromised
- [ ] if the subject sent the certificate over an unprotected channel
- [ ] none of the above
###### Question
Which of the following statements about CRL and OCSP are correct?
- [x] CRL is a list of revoked certificates issued by a CA
- [ ] CRL is a list of revoked certificates issued by a root CA
- [ ] OCSP is a protocol to query a server about the validity of a single specific certificate at a specified time
- [x] OCSP is a protocol to query a server about the validity of a single specific certificate at the current time
###### Question
Alice sends a digitally signed message to Bob and attaches her X.509v3 certificate (and a certificate chain up to a trusted root CA). Which steps must Bob perform to verify the signature on the message? (you can select multiple responses from the ones below)
- [ ] verify the signature on the message by using the certificate of Alice
- [ ] verify that the certificate of Alice is authentic by constructing the chain up to a trusted root and verifying the signatures on each certificate in the chain
- [ ] verify that each certificate in the chain (except the one of the trusted root) has not been revoked
- [ ] do not check the trusted root CA certificate that Alice sent him because he should have it already configured it as trusted
