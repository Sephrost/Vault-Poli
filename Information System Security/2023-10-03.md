# Introduction
In the past, attacks took place physically, accessing the terminal from where it was installed. Nowadays attacks can take place over the internet.

An attack can have many consequences, which includes:
- **financial loss**, direct(eg: fund transfer) or indirect(eg: value of a share)
- **recovery cost**, to take the system back to an operation state
- **productivity loss**
- **business disruption**
- **reputation damage**, with consequent difficulty to regain trust

> First Axiom of engineering
> The **more complex** a system is, the **more difficult** its **correctness verification** will be (implementation, management, operation)
>
> The systems are getting more and more complex as time goes, so they can be an easy prey for attackers. A simpler system is preferred for security.

## Risk Estimation and Management
First of all some terminology.

An asset is a set of goods needed for an IT service. All assets can generate some risk in case of cyber attack, such as data, ITC and human resources.

A vulnerability is an intrinsic weakness of an asset which is generated by a threat.
A threat is a possible deliberate action or accidental event that can produce a loss of a security propriety by exploiting a vulnerability.

Mani risks can thus be identified, but the resources(time, budget,$\dots$) to manage all of them are limited, so an organization has to decide which one to address at all. The decision ca be taken using a **risk assessment matrix**(or risk heat map), which provides a visual way to represent risk.

To manage the risk we have to select and implement some countermeasures, to mitigate the impact or address the problem. At a later date, a different figure have to audit the process to check if the issue has been fixed correctly.

The security measures should be implemented by the start of the development cycle until the system is finally ready to go live.

> Security control is a component implemented in the system to protect against threats

###### Data breach and data disclosure
An incident that results in the disclosure or potential exposure of data.
A data disclosure is a breach for which it was confirmed that data was actually disclosed (not just exposed) to an unauthorized party
###### Window of exposure

### MICE
- Money: direct transfer, blackmail etc.
- Ideology: political, hacktivism
- Compromise: individuals with no choice due to blackmail or threat against their families or themselves
- Ego: "we do it because we can"
### Threat actors

### the standards
Some standards that we will consider are:
- ISO(International Organization for Standardization), which is a company
- ITU-T(International Telecommunication Union, Telecommunication standardization sector)
- ISOC (internet society), which is divided in:
	- IETF(Internet Engineering Task Force)
	- IRTF(Internet Research Task Force)
- NIST(National Institute of Standards & Technology)
- ANSI(American National Standards Institute)
- ETSI (European Telecommunications Standards Institute)
- CEN (European Committee for Standardization)
- CENELEC (European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization)
### Some security principle
Flaws in a system are inevitable, as so is advised to reduce the risk of exposure regardless of the product or patches.

Security in depth: since we cant rely on a product, which can be vulnerable, as any other one, is advised to use multiple different systems of security "just in case".

Security by design: each step of a application life cycle must have security in mind

Security by default: security measures must be implemented by the vendor and should not be applied by the power user

Least privilege: give an user the minimum grade of privilege possible an each given time

Need-to-know: give access to each users on a system only the information which needs to know, and nothing else, to minimize the effect of the attack

### C.I.A
- **Confidentiality**: **preserving authorized restrictions** on information access and disclosure, including means for protecting personal privacy and proprietary information, which covers two concepts:
	- Data confidentiality:Assures that private or confidential information is not made available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals
	 - Privacy: Assures that individuals control or influence what information related to them may be collected and stored and by whom and to whom that information may be disclosed.
- **Integrity**: guarding against *improper information modification* or *destruction*, which covers two related concepts:
	- System integrity: Assures that a system performs its intended function in an unimpaired manner
	 - Data integrity: Assures that data (both stored and in transmitted packets) and programs are changed only in a specified and authorized manner.
- **Availability**: Ensuring timely and reliable access to and use of information.
