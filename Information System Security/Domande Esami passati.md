# Chapter 1 - Introduction to the security of networks and information systems
### Talk about sniffing, spoofing and hijacking attacks and describe the appropriate security measures
- A sniffing attack happens when someone reads the packets not addressed to another network node to detect sensible information
	- Sniffing compromises the confidentiality of the communication, and can be made useless by encrypting the payload of the message
	- Avoid using broadcast during the communication
- A spoofing attacks refer to the falsification of the source of a packet, typically of the IP or mac source addresses.
	- A solution is authenticating the source of the packet by not using its address
- Hijacking is also called man in the middle, and refers to the hijack of a connects made by a party by manipulating or deleting packets.
	- It can be avoided by ensuring confidentiality, authentication an integrity
