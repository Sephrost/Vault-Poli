> most application nowadays use end-to-end communication, but some don't, like email
### Non repudiation
Is a propriety, which indicates that a sender cannot deny the creation of a data.

It prevents either the sender or the receiver for denying a transmitted message.

Is a really strong authentication, that is even accepted in a court of justice.

> Electronic firm is not repudiable, which even assures integrity and authentication.

### Data protection
Data comes in many forms. for each security propriety consider always the three cases of data protection:
- data in transit: when data are transmitted over a communication channel
- data at rest: when data are stored in a memory device 
- data at work: when data are in RAM for use by a process
### From where attacks take place?
Attackers may attack a system form many places, as such the appropriate security measures mus be used:
- attack from outside the organization: in this case is important to define the perimeter and defend it, for example with a firewall 
- attack from outside the organization, with the exception of a partner
- attack from inside an organization: intranet protection should be used, protecting the LAN

As we have seen, attacks may come from **everywhere**, so is important to apply protection at every level, implementing [**Zero Trust Application**](https://www.nist.gov/publications/zero-trust-architecture)(*ZTA*).

Attackers can try to sniff a communication from many points:
- Man in the middle: the attacker sniff the traffic sitting between two peers
- Man at the end: the attacker sniffs the traffic inside one peer
- Man in the browser: the attacker sniffs the traffic inside one specific component of one peer(typically the browser)
### Two kinds of attacks
An attacker can also make two kinds of attacks:
- a passive one, which allows him to read only the data or traffic. this kind of attacks are very difficult to detect, because they don't involve any alteration of the data.
- an active one, which allows him to read but also modify, delete or create data or traffic
### Some attacks
Now we try to explain some techniques of attack.
#### Masquerade(IP Spoofing)
A masquerade takes place when one entity pretends to be a different entity.

An IP Spoofing attack involves modifying an IP datagramm(level 3) to make it look like it came from another source, to fake being another entity.

It can cause some issues when an application is using address-based authentication, so it should not be used.
#### Packet sniffing
Packet sniffing is a passive attack which allows an attacker to read the packets addressed to another host on the network.

A countermeasure is encrypting the payload(the header cannot be encrypted) or using non-broadcast networks.
#### Denial of service(DoS)
The denial of service prevents or inhibits the normal use or management of communication facilities. It keeps an host busy so that it can't provide its services.

It is not usually executed by a single entity, but from multiple one, making it a **Distributed denial of service**(*DDoS*), typically using a botnet controlled by a master.

It can also involve the use a **reflector**, which is another node that allows to hide the attacker address and, in some cases, allows to multiply the attacker, such as in case of smurf attack.

In some cases the use of an amplification factor($N:1$).
