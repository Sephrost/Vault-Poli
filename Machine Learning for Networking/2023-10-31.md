#### Outliers
Outliers re **extreme values**, that can either be error in the measurements or accurate reports of rare events.

We can deal with them based on the *domain knowledge*:
- Information about where the data come from and what they mean
- it depends on what analysis you are planning to address
##### How to detect them
Outliers can be detected through:
● Univariate analysis
– Boxplot
– Percentiles
– Histograms
– GESD
– …
● Multivariate analysis
– DBSCAN
– …
● More specific techniques
##### Outlier Detection GESD
GESD, or Generalized Extreme Studentized Deviate, is used to detect one or more outliers in a univariate data set that follows a normal distribution.

The GESD test performs separate tests for 1 outlier up to an upper bound $k$ of outliers.

$$R=\frac{max_{x=1,\dots,m}|x_i-\bar{x}|}{\sigma}$$
With $\bar{x}$ and $\sigma$ denoting the sample mean and sample standard deviation, respectively

> It is also called *Generalized Grubbs test*.
