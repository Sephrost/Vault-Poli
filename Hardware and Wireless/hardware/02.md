The design of circuits that are probably sold at large scale(large production).
They are likely to have complex design.
### 3
![[hardware/converted/Slide 02/-03.png]]
Uuslaly we design rectangles(?).
### 4
![[hardware/converted/Slide 02/-04.png]]
We can start from designing the system, indiviating the different modules needed. those are composed by logical ports, or gates, which are mate by circuits.
### 5
![[hardware/converted/Slide 02/-05.png]]
Lets start from the device point of view.
90% of electronics  are made of MOS transistors. We have 3 electrodes: 
- a gate 
- a source 
- a drain
Transistors rely on semiconductors, silicon, also called bulk.
> one dice is one chip.

Starting from the bulk we build layers of insulators an a metal in a certain geometry to obtain a certain circuit.
It is actually a 4 terminal device.

A transistor in nothing more that a electronic switch, which is switched by the gate.

### 6
![[hardware/converted/Slide 02/-06.png]]
If i am applaying a voltage on the gate, we can turn it on and off.
### 7
![[hardware/converted/Slide 02/-07.png]]

### 8
![[hardware/converted/Slide 02/-08.png]]
We introduce current and voltages to the system.
We have voltage between the gate and the source, between the source and the drain.

The amount of current that flows trough the system is modulated by those two gates.
$$I_{DS}=f(V_{GS},V_{DS})$$

### 9
![[hardware/converted/Slide 02/-09.png]]
The channel behaves like a resistor.
### 10
![[hardware/converted/Slide 02/-10.png]]
The resistance that we have in each elements depends from the length and the section.
Since the transistor behaves like a resistance that opposes the current, the resistance will depend on the geometry.
The geometry of the resistance have thus an impact.
The distance between the drain and the source is the channel. by making it smaller we are reducing the resistance.

The channel also extends in the Z direction. If it very large, the resistance decreases. This is because we have a lot of surface.

If we fix the voltage, and we have a resistance that is changing, we are also changing the current.
### 11
![[hardware/converted/Slide 02/-11.png]]
> We are not proving that.

- We cannot module the first 3 parameters, because they depend on the technology
- We can modulate the circuit and the geometry
### 12
![[hardware/converted/Slide 02/-12.png]]
Experimental results shows that if we have no current we have no voltage.
If the current reaches the maximum it remain constant, mt it saturates.

A transistor works an an ideal current generator.
The current between the drain and the source in sautration is $I_{DSS}$, then the current depends on the technological parameter, the second is the radio between W and L(the geometry) and $(V_{GS}-V_t)^2$.

Analog electronics work a=on the concept that a transistor is an analog amplifier, by exploiting it as so.
### 13
![[hardware/converted/Slide 02/-13.png]]
If we have low voltage on the gate the transistor is off.
If we have voltage on the gate it is on.
If both have voltage the channel is on but we have no corren(no voltage difference).
If the voltage between the drain and the source, with enough current, it is in saturation.
This ,we have the only two possibility,the transistor is off, or we have enough current to reach the saturation point, being on.
### 14
![[hardware/converted/Slide 02/-14.png]]
We have to clarify that we have many possible king of transistors.
### 15
![[hardware/converted/Slide 02/-15.png]]
First rectangle that we have to draw is not the gate, but the region when the nMOS transistor is built.
### 16
![[hardware/converted/Slide 02/-16.png]]
Then we define the gate, or channel.
### 17
![[hardware/converted/Slide 02/-17.png]]
Then we add contacts for the source and the drain.
this layout is not showing the entire picture.
We have to add the access component to the bulk.
### 18
![[hardware/converted/Slide 02/-18.png]]
The surface of the component cannot be arbitrary.
This depends on the technology(or design rules, a set or rules about the geometry).
### 19
![[hardware/converted/Slide 02/-19.png]]
Is exactly the incers of a mMOS transistor.
We rely on a p-type bulk, bulking on top of it a well.
### 20
![[hardware/converted/Slide 02/-20.png]]
It works like an n-type one, but with current that flows in the opposite direction.
### 21
![[hardware/converted/Slide 02/-21.png]]

### 22
![[hardware/converted/Slide 02/-22.png]]
If we have a input, we have the opposite as the output.
### 23
![[hardware/converted/Slide 02/-23.png]]
Since the nType transistor is off, we have no current flowing to the mtype.

### 24
![[hardware/converted/Slide 02/-24.png]]

### 25
![[hardware/converted/Slide 02/-25.png]]
Increasing the n. of transistor, we can create even more complex gates.
IN is input.
### 26
![[hardware/converted/Slide 02/-26.png]]

### 27
![[hardware/converted/Slide 02/-27.png]]

### 28
![[hardware/converted/Slide 02/-28.png]]
With nand and nor we can design any combination function.
### 29
![[hardware/converted/Slide 02/-29.png]]
We have to stick to the design rules. So sometimes we are wasting space, which can also be a problem.`
Wehave to manage both the space and the time needed to design the system.

The output value is function of input and the timer.
A combinational circuit has no feedback.
