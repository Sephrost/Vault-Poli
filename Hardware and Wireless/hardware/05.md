> Disturbance is basically setting the memory to a known state that have an effect on the system as a whole(the setup for a side channel attack).
### 32

We create two channel:
- one encrypted, to protect the way the message reach the memory
- on in plain, for what doesnt need to be encrypted.
This makes our system slower, because encryption can be heavy, and consumes more power, but there's an argument to encrypt everything, so that the attacker doesnt know where the important data is located.
The surface of attacks thus, is not the memory, but the registers of the CPU, where the data is decrypted, or inside the system on chip, which is more likely.

A full tree is not needed, because if a block its changed all the tree from the leaf to the root has to be updated, which includes finding the position of every node.
With an ash tree we don't have memory correction, including the subtree where the error occurred.

We'd like to protect the execution inside the hardware, at the hardware level.
The 4 principle are
- protect the communication, making complex to extrapolate information fetched from the memory, encryption by itself is not enough
- isolate the processor state, even when trusted
- allow introspection
- monitor the TEE and TCB at any point
For those reason, we can formally verify the correctness of the hardware. But the more complex it it, the harder it is to do so.

> with encryption we protect very specific data, and not in the communication.
### 55

To isolate everything, the state has to be guaranteed, even when a context switch occur. this is because it could leak information about the previous context.
Each time the state needs to be flushed from the microprocessor.
### 56
![[hardware/converted/Slide 05/-56.png]]
We need to authenticate what is happening. 
### 57
![[hardware/converted/Slide 05/-57.png]]
Establishing TEEs is not enough by itself, because if leakage occurs between the switch from an trusted environment to a trusted one, we need monitoring to guarantee that the execution is not exploitable.
### 58
![[hardware/converted/Slide 05/-58.png]]
Those are wrong attitudes.
