Developing a complex electronic system has become a issue of connection things, because all the intellectual properties, the reusable units developed as building blocks, just need to be put together instead of being rebuild from the ground up.

The problem is just the verification of the system correctness, compatibility, security and licensing. The first 2 are not that important for the purpose of this course.

> Licensing refers to using another IP while paying for it.
> This can be paying for the design or an item based rule(eg: 1 cent per item).

> Security is not an issue usually when developing in house, usually, but if developed by someone else it can be an major issue.

Furthermore, there's the problem for the IP holder to enforce its property, which can be
- soft IP, which can be the HDL code
- hard IP, which is usually the layout
they have to be provided to an external part of the supply chain, which is not under the holder control. So we must be sure that there's no vulnerabilities in the design.
### 3
![[hardware/converted/Slide 03/-03.png]]
The solution is to trust the provided IP.
But sometimes someone has some interest to reverse engineer the product, so hardening is necessary, to avoid the leakage of informations.
This is not the only concern:
- Backdoors
- tampering
- Trojans
- ...
Dealing with hardware security is a big topic after all.

Watermarking means adding a signature to the integrated circuit such tat its very difficult to discover the functioning an replicating it without being found out.

The watermark must not:
- difficult to be removed
- not alter the functionalities of the IP(duh)
- Not degrade performance
- Not leak informations
- verifiable: the owner ...
### 5
![[hardware/converted/Slide 03/-05.png]]
Watermarking is also used in multimedia, such as pictures or videos. But this alters the data, but we cannot do that in an IC, because it cannot alter the functionality.

> The domain is completely different.
### 6
![[hardware/converted/Slide 03/-06.png]]
Two families of techniques: static or dynamic.

Static add a signature in the IC, but verifying it is very difficult, because it is expensive(microscopic analysis), so its not very used.

### 7
![[hardware/converted/Slide 03/-07.png]]
Because we cannot influence performance, we add constraint that act as a watermark.
We also add several signature, such as we have a lot of constraints to be satisfied, making the watermark "stronger".
### 8
![[hardware/converted/Slide 03/-08.png]]
It can be modeled as a constraint satisfaction problem, which is NP, so polynomial time solution is known.

It is modeled as follow: assume $C$ constraints, each with probability $p$ of being satisfied.
Then let $X$ be a random variable that represent how many constraints are not satisfied, then the probability to have $b$, or less, constraints not satisfied is
$$P(X\le b )=\sum^b_{i=0}\binom{C}{i}p^{C-i}\cdot(1-p)^i$$

> this is the list of possible constraints

Those constraints can be introduces at different abstraction level:
- system level
- register allocation
- synthesis level
- ...
### 10
![[hardware/converted/Slide 03/-10.png]]
We add constraints at the schedule of the operations.
### 11
![[hardware/converted/Slide 03/-11.png]]
> each line is a time slot.

We can anticipate, or delay tasks, and we use that as a watermark. All this without altering the performances, at the cost of freedom.

### 13

> It lower than system level.

We check the intermediate results, which are consumed at different time of the execution.
We check the lifetime, and determine how many registers we need to store variables.
### 14
![[hardware/converted/Slide 03/-14.png]]
We exploit the configuration as a watermark, because it is very hard to replicate by chance.

### 16
![[hardware/converted/Slide 03/-16.png]]

### 17
![[hardware/converted/Slide 03/-17.png]]
We still have to embed the signature, to force the coloring in a certain direction.

In the end, we generate a kind of secret key, which a sequence of bits.
### 18
![[hardware/converted/Slide 03/-18.png]]
> the signature is random in this case.

embedding a 1 is a connection between $v_1$ and $v_3$ because of the rule.

To embed at synthesis level we have to be careful not to decrease performance.
### 25
![[hardware/converted/Slide 03/-25.png]]
We exploit the fact that when we are performing the logic synthesis we have a constraint at the maximum clock frequency, so we have a path in the whole design that complies with the requirement.
We don't add any further logic, but we 
### 26
![[hardware/converted/Slide 03/-26.png]]
We don't add any further logic, but we work an that mapping approach.
We try to find a good mapping between the primary inputs and the outputs.
We can map some block according to some logic and others with another one, by breaking down the blocks into smaller ones.

![[hardware/converted/Slide 03/-35.png]]
We embed the signature at design time only to check that at runtime, with this solution being cheaper to implement.

### 36
![[hardware/converted/Slide 03/-36.png]]
We use finite state machines to check the correctness.
We embeds the watermark in the states and transitions.
The watermark can be either the states or the transitions.

the testing can be both offline, in a testing environment, or online, mounted in a system and running.
We set up some special fliflos 
### 42
![[hardware/converted/Slide 03/-42.png]]
Basic idea: fliflos have two outputs: Q and $\not Q$.
We leave the unused one unconnected. 
This configuration represent our watermark.
If two test produce the same sequence bounder scan, its unlikely that they produce the same output.
