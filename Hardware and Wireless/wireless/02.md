We want several signal to coexist over the same channel.
We can rely on basic modulation types(those 3), which alters the properties of a signal.

For 0 small amplitude, for 1 larger one.
We need to understand that at the receiver.
### 12
![[wireless/converted/Slide 02/-12.png]]
When a signal is not modulated by a cosine is called a baseband signal.
when modulated, its then called a bandpass signal.
### 13

(the simplest of those modulations)
We focus on a very basic signal( like a rectangular function).
We need to have to change the signal to represents 0 and 1s.
We choose 2 different amplititudes.
### 14

We are actually able to transmit more bits by using $M$ different signals levels, one for each transmitted bit.

(the more distant is the signal from the origin, the larger the energy).
More energy make errors less prone to occur.

More simbles across it increase the probability of errors.

The amplifier scale the PSK of the constellation, amplifying by the same amount.
The QAM constellation has some problems: all the symbols reach the same amplitude when reaching the saturation point. This results in a lot of errors.
QAM can be useful for satellite communication, because we need very powerful amplifiers, exploiting the saturation region.

the signal is added to the noise, which distorts it.
### 38
![[wireless/converted/Slide 02/-38.png]]
the original signal, when passing trough $h_c$ is delayed and scaled. This is called multi path
### 39
![[wireless/converted/Slide 02/-39.png]]
The receiver should mitigate this two effects
the general approach is to "clean" the signal to then sample it

Orthogonality means that the scalar product is zero
$$\int^{+\infty}_{-\infty}x(t)y(t)\text{dt}=0$$
this is true also for the codes
$$\int^{+\infty}_{-\infty}c_1(t)c_2(t)=0$$
This means that
$$Y(t)=x(t)c_1+y(t)c_2$$
so
$$<y(t),c_2(t)>=\int^{\infty}_{-\infty}(S_1(t)c_1(t)+S_2(t)C_2(T))\cdot C_2(T)$$
where $S_1$ and $S_2$ are two signals.

the assign the shorter code for the most common symbol.

There are two main compression types, that can be loseless or lossy. The implementation depends of the application that implements it(needs).
There is a tradeoff between compression efficiency and computational comprexity.

we removed all the redundancy.
But to detect and correct errors we have to still add some, with different codes, to make signals more resilient to errors.
