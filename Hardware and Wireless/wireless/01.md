We want to understand what we mean with physical layer.
Our goal is to transmit bits on a physical data link, thus we have to deal with signals.

We are dealing with wireless channels, so is a security concern, because anyone can receive the signals, there's no physical protection.

Also jamming is a concearn, because anyone can generate a transmission.

Replaying is actually very dangerous for gps positioning, so it is also a security concern.

Jamming can transmit literally anything, it doeesnt matter what.

### 13

The user section consist in the transmitter and the receiver, that want to communicate.
The communication can be both analog and digital. The communication can be converted at any stage. eg microphone starts in analog and becomes a sequence of bits(digital).

The channel section is the physical medium, that can only propagate analog waveforms. We want to transmit digital signal but we are forced to use analog one.

To move the signal from the user to the analog channel, we have to use a interface to prepare the information flow(conveying it).
It transforms bits to analog signal, compressing them, encoding and associating bits to signal waveforms.

### 14
![[wireless/converted/Slide 01/-14.png]]
We have an encoder, divided in two parts.
The encoder basically compress the data.

the first one encodes and the second one makes it more robust.
### 15
![[wireless/converted/Slide 01/-15.png]]
The channel transmit signals from interface to interface.
### 16
![[wireless/converted/Slide 01/-16.png]]
We have the dual counterpart on the receiver part.

Is the way with which a mathematical function to carry some informations about any quantity...

Signals can be analog and digital.
### 19
![[wireless/converted/Slide 01/-19.png]]
This is true for physical signals, sometimes we can have comprex signals(more functions at once).
### 20

### 21
![[wireless/converted/Slide 01/-21.png]]
When we are dealing with physical layer, we are talking about power and energy, this functions gives an idea: the energy of a signal is the integral of this function, modulus square.

This way we get a scalar value, which varies over time.
The value of the area obtained by the integral is our energy.
### 22
![[wireless/converted/Slide 01/-22.png]]
Similar, we have the definition of power.
We can compute the instantaneous power of a signal, but most commonly we compute the average power.

> this is similar as before.

We are averaging the integral over the interval we are integrating.
Its also a scalar number.
### 23

### 24
![[wireless/converted/Slide 01/-24.png]]
Representation can be vary complicated: for instance, a signal can be a sum of elementary signals.

The scalar product between signals is a scalar value, which is a measure of the similarity among signals.
If two function are quite similar we will get a large number.
It it is zero, they are said to be orthogonal.

Understanding this, allows us to associate signals with frequency components, allowing us to do spectral analysis.
### 25
![[wireless/converted/Slide 01/-25.png]]
A very important example of signal representation is the I/Q representation.
This two elementary signals are very common and used to build any other signal.

We can chose any point, and represent a signal out of it by associating it to those functions.
### 26
![[wireless/converted/Slide 01/-26.png]]

### 27
![[wireless/converted/Slide 01/-27.png]]
We change the elementary component.
We consider as a elementary function the complex exponential.
This function is characterized by a frequency, and that all we care about.

For higher frequency the components are smaller.
### 28
![[wireless/converted/Slide 01/-28.png]]
We are now decomposing a signal over a continuous set of frequency.

X(F) represent how much of a frequency is in a signal.

### 32
![[wireless/converted/Slide 01/-32.png]]
Instead of trasmitting it fro mthe zero frequency, we need to move it to the 1.5Ghz. 
### 33
![[wireless/converted/Slide 01/-33.png]]
Is one of the most important operations.
Im multiplying a signal on a cosine, shifting the content in frequency. Tis is not in a symmetrical way.

### 40
![[wireless/converted/Slide 01/-40.png]]
The transmitter side might transmit both analog or digital informations.
Digital information is more sophisticated.
But we still need to convert analog signal into a numerical signal.
### 41
![[wireless/converted/Slide 01/-41.png]]
To transform an analog signal to a digital one, first of all we need to sample the signal. This operation can be done without losing information.
After that, we need to quantize the sample, at discrete times, because we have a continuous time function. Each value obtained is associated with a given amplitude level, and to each of the them we assign a number, converted into binary digits(information).
The larger the set of bits, the larger the set of data re presentable, in terms of accuracy.
the smaller the set, the larger the approximation.
At the end of the day, we get a digital signal.
### 42
![[wireless/converted/Slide 01/-42.png]]
The sampling operation is a lossless one thanks to the nyquist theorem, which says that if we sample fast enough(twice the bandwidth) we are able to reconstruct perfectly the data.
### 43
![[wireless/converted/Slide 01/-43.png]]
The faster the signal, the more sample are needed.
We can never completely satisfy this rule tho.`
