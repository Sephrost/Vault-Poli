## Routing algorithm
routing algorithms are used to determine a good path from the sender to the receivers, trough network routers.

For this purpose, we represent the network as a graph, where the vertices are the host and the arcs are the links.
### Classification
One way in which we can classify routing algorithms is according to whether they are centralized or decentralized:
- centralized: computes the least-cost path between a source and destination using complete, global knowledge about the network. This then requires that the algorithm somehow obtain this information before actually performing the calculation.
	- Algorithms with global state information are often referred to as link-state (LS) algorithms,
- decentralized: the calculation of the least-cost path is carried out in an iterative, distributed manner by the routers.

another way to classify routing algorithms is whether they
are static or dynamic:
- In static routing algorithms, routes change very slowly over
time, often as a result of human intervention
- Dynamic routing algorithms change the routing paths as the network traffic loads or topology change
