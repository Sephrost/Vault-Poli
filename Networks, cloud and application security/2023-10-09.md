###### Exercise 4
Define an IP addressing plan for the network in the figure. 
Consider both a “traditional” addressing plan and a solution that could minimize the number of deployed addresses. 
> Assume to utilize the 10.0.0.0/16 address range.

> It's easier to start assigning addresses from the bigger subnet(with more devices)

Subnet A requires 352(350 for the hosts, the broadcast address, the interface of the router and another address that i dont know) addresses, subnet b requires 122 addresses and we need 4 addresses for the tunnel.

Thus for subnet A have thus prefix $/23$($32-9$) because we need $2^9$ addresses to accommodate that much addresses(in this case we can accommodate 512 addresses), for subnet B the prefix is $/25$
