### MPLS
**MPLS**, or multi-protocol label switching, is a enabling technology for the New Broadband (IP) Public Network.

Back in the 90' the network stack was really complex(ATM, frame relays, SONET, ...). MPLS was proposed as a solution to this problem, which is actually just a modification of IP, by adding the capability to run any kind of traffic in a reliable manner.

It is only used on large networks, and only at the core of the network.
#### The idea
Most of the packets are  forwarded by looking at its header.

MPLS proposes to forward the packets according to a label instead. In this manner, the overhead of a lookup is smaller(20 bit instead of 32), without the need to search for the longest matching prefix. The label is thus used ad an index for the forwarding table.

The label also allows to do traffic engineering, because it is connection oriented.
#### Label switch path
The path that the packet follows inside the MPLS cloud is called **label switch path** or **LSP tunnel**.

Following this path, each node reads the label of the packet, change it and then forward it according to the original one.
#### Shim header
The MPLS header sits between the layer 2 header and the layer 3 one.

It contains a 20 bit label, followed by 3 experimental bits, which are currently not used, a bottom of stack bit, and 8 bit which represent the time to live.
